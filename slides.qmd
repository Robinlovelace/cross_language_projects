# Introduction

## Why make a presentation with Quarto and continuous deployment?

- Allows you to test ideas in a standalone environment
- Sharing materials with collaborators and the audience
- Continuous deployment automates the process of updating the slides and ensures reproducibility

## How to get started?

- Check out the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/)
  - Especially the [Publishing](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) section
- You can use this repository as a template for your own slides, go to https://github.com/Robinlovelace/reproducible-slides-repo-template and clone it
- Note: the approach here is to publish the slides as part of a Quarto website project so it can be used for other purposes too, e.g. if you want to write a paper building on the slides

## Extensions

Add extensions with the following code (which adds the [`clean-revealjs`](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean) extension, for example, which has a detailed demo hosted at [github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo](https://github.com/grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean-demo/blob/main/template.qmd)):

```sh
quarto install extension grantmcdermott/quarto-revealjs-clean
```

Then replace:

```
format: 
  revealjs: default
```

with:

```
format: 
  clean-revealjs:
    self-contained: true
```

In the YAML header of your `.qmd` file.

# Publishing slides (and more)

## Setting-up `gh-pages` branch

You can do this with a single quarto command:

``` sh
quarto publish gh-pages
```

Which leads to the following text and eventually auto-opens the deployed webiste!

## The website

The previous command creates a `gh-pages` branch with the slides in the `docs` folder. This is then automatically deployed to GitHub Pages, and the website is opened in your browser when ready:

How awesome is that?

## Debugging

Source of `quarto publish gh-pages` hint: [Error message from GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/reproducible-slides-repo-template/actions/runs/10860601182/job/30141397336#step:4:34) when trying to publish slides to GitHub Pages:

```         
ERROR: Unable to publish to GitHub Pages (the remote origin does not have a branch named "gh-pages". Use first `quarto publish gh-pages` locally to initialize the remote repository for publishing.)
```

# Adding citations {background-color="#40666e"}

## With the Quarto extension

-   You need to be in Visual Editor mode (Ctrl+Shift+F4)
-   Then it's Ctrl+Shift+F8

Creates citations like this: [@peng2011]

## With "Citation Picker for Zotero" extension

-   Issue with this approach: doesn't generate the .bib file
